# AI-Based-Epileptic-Seizure-Prediction
This project aims to predict epileptic seizures using EEG signal analysis with machine learning and deep learning techniques. It leverages real-world EEG datasets (especially pediatric data) to train models that can detect patterns indicating potential seizures. The goal is to provide real-time alerts for early intervention and improved patient care.
